\section{Outlook}
\todo{TODO future-work}
\todo{TODO choose s-t-pairs better (Karlsruhers' routes?)}
\todo{TODO Instead of statically analyzing the network, which costs performance, the metrics could be used heuristically depending on the street-type.}
\todo{TODO optimize contraction-hierarchies-query -> 10x with stall-on-demand}
\todo{TODO Braess-paradoxon: Is there an improvement after removing some streets? -> this metric as heuristic for removing streets? ATTENTION: stable state (equilibrium) needed for braess-paradoxon}
\todo{TODO Other, non-uniform test-routes -> better distribution?}
\todo{TODO Problem: many routes}
\todo{TODO Two metrics}
\todo{TODO no tolerance when balancing, but a tolerance when evaluating}
