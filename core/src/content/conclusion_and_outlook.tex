    TODO future-work

\todo{%
    TODO choose s-t-pairs better (Karlsruhers' routes?)
}
\todo{%
    TODO Instead of statically analyzing the network, which costs performance, the metrics could be used heuristically depending on the street-type.
}
\todo{%
    TODO optimize contraction-hierarchies-query -> 10x with stall-on-demand
}
\todo{%
    TODO Braess-paradoxon: Is there an improvement after removing some streets? -> this metric as heuristic for removing streets? ATTENTION: stable state (equilibrium) needed for braess-paradoxon
}
\todo{%
    TODO Other, non-uniform test-routes -> better distribution?
}
\todo{%
    TODO Problem: many routes
}
\todo{%
    TODO Two metrics
}
\todo{%
    TODO no tolerance when balancing, but a tolerance when evaluating
}
\todo{%
    TODO Maybe a problem: high performance-needs needed, but balancing
}
\todo{%
    TODO Spreaded routes might ignore travel-time for crossroads, but same argument holds for non-spreaded routes ignoring traffic-jams.
