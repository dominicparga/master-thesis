\section{Outlook}
% - TODO future-work
% - choose s-t-pairs better (Karlsruhers' routes?)
% - Instead of statically analyzing the network, which costs performance, the metrics could be used heuristically depending on the street-type.
% - optimize contraction-hierarchies-query -> 10x with stall-on-demand
% - Braess-paradoxon: Is there an improvement after removing some streets? -> this metric as heuristic for removing streets? ATTENTION: stable state (equilibrium) needed for braess-paradoxon
