Let assume drivers driving to somewhere a little further away, like work.
A navigation-system, asked for the fastest route, usually returns a route over larger streets, like highways.
These larger streets probably have multiple lanes and allow a higher speed-limit than smaller streets, resulting in a high driver-capacity and hence a high throughput.
When many drivers receive the same answer from their independent navigation-systems, the traffic tends to overload these larger streets.
In addition, due to rush-hours, the traffic is not balanced over the day.
All these aspects leads to traffic-jams, resulting in former fast routes becoming inefficient.
Besides environmental impact and circumstances to handle the daily amount of rush-hour-traffic, traffic-jams in large (capital) cities cost days of the people's time and hence much money per year.~\cite{inrix:traffic-cost}

    \section{Related Work}

    To solve this issue, dynamic routing can be used.
    For example, Google has gathered~\cite{barth:google-traffic} anonymous data from Android-users to predict traffic-jams in the street-network.
    Since most smartphones use Android~\cite{kantar:android-vs-ios}, there is enough data being collectable for sufficient accuracy.
    Although, this approach requires a global observer, including infrastructure, and data-packages, in street-networks represented by drivers, able to or willing to share their location in the network.
    For example, in wireless-networks, data-packages are transmitted (kind of) and traffic-jams occur in nodes, not in their connections; or the network (e.g. Internet) could be too large to be observable.
    In such cases, heuristics have to be taken into account to determine the traffic of neighbouring nodes.
    This cost throughput and/or capacity (hence money).
