\section{Graphs and paths}

    A graph $G = (V, E)$ with vertices $V$ and edges $E$ has $d$ \glspl{weight} per edge.
    \Glspl{weight} are also called \glspl{cost} or \glspl{metric}, depending on the context.

\section{Dijkstra's algorithm (bidirectional)}

    \todo{TODO Explain only CH-Query}

    \todo{TODO write}

    \subsection{Correctness-proof of bidirectional Dijkstra}

        \todo{TODO Remove proof if not needed in the thesis (probably not needed).}

        \todo{
            TODO The termination of the bidirectional Astar is based on the first node v, that is marked by both, the forward- and the backward-subroutine.
            However, this common node v is part of the shortest path s->t wrt to this particular hop-distance H, but doesn't have to be part of the shortest path s->t wrt to \glspl{weight}.

            Every node, that is not settled in any of the both subroutines, has a longer distance to both s and t than the already found common node v and hence can not be part of the shortest path (wrt to \glspl{weight}).
            Otherwise, it would have been settled before v since the priority-queues sort by \glspl{weight}.
            In other words, only already settled nodes and their neighbors (which are already enqueued) can be part of the shortest path.

            In conclusion, emptying the remaining nodes in the queues and picking the shortest path of the resulting common nodes leads to the shortest path wrt to \glspl{weight} from s to t.
        }

        \todo{%
            TODO extend proof onto A* with \gls{contraction-hierarchies}: Here, the proof for bidirectional \gls{dijkstra} doesn't hold, because each sub-graph doesn't visit every node of the total graph, due to the level-filter when pushing edges to the queue.
            Hence, the forward- and the backward-query are not balanced wrt \glspl{weight}.
            Thus, after finding the first meeting-node, the hop-distance of the shortest-path could be arbitrary.
            This leads to wrong paths with normal bidirectional \gls{dijkstra}.
            To correct this issue, stop the query after polling a node of a sub-distance, which is higher than the currently best meeting-node's total distance.
        }

\section{Personalized routing}

    \todo{TODO write}
    \Gls{personalized_routing} reduces the multidimensional \glspl{metric} via dot-product with a preference-vector to one dimension.

\section{Contraction-hierarchies}

    \todo{TODO write}

    \subsection{Overview}

    \todo{TODO write}

    \subsection{Computing shortcuts of multiple \glspl{metric} with LP/ILP (TODO title)}

    \todo{TODO write}

\section{(Restricted) Enumerating personalized routing}

    \todo{TODO write}
    \todo{TODO acronym (R)EPR and link to Barth's paper(s)}
    \todo{TODO \gls{repr} is just a runtime-optimization of \gls{epr}}
    \todo{TODO Routes within a certain tolerance of the best possible \gls{cost} (per \gls{metric}, \eg\ duration must be not worse than $25~\%$ \todo{tolerance should match the resulting plots}) are randomly chosen from cyclops.}

    \subsection{Idea}

        \todo{TODO write; Here could be talked about the approach of removing the nd-triangulation and how cyclops takes this idea/context and makes it correct by building convex-hull explicitly (because new facets could destroy old facets).}

    \subsection{TODO Proof of correctness + completeness}

    \todo{TODO write}
